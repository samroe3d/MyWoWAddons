Junk Filter by CaptJack2883

Version 1.13
	New Features:
	You can now select the quality of items to delete. It still waits until the bags are full before deleting anything, and you can select individual qualities. Be careful when selecting higher qualities, as there is no way to undelete items, but it should still ask to confirm deletion of Uncommon and higher items.

	Bug Fixes:
	Fixed LUA Errors
	Updated Options Screen
	Changed Verbose Mode into Reporting Mode, which is less spammy, but still reports the items that are deleted. This is now turned on by default for new installations, but existing users will need to activate the checkbox in interface options.
	Added title text to main window.

	Updated TOC File for Patch 9.0
	Fixed background due to Shadowlands updates.

Version 1.10

	requested, please let me know how much info is enough or too much.

	I also fixed the problem of missing the expected amount of empty slots.

	You can change the options by clicking the Options button, or going into Interface Options under Addons.
