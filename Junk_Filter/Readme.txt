Junk Filter by CaptJack2883

This addon will delete junk (grey) items when your bags are full.
It will ignore any bags that are considered 'specialty' which is any bag that is not a standard container capable of holding any type of item. 
You can customize the number of empty bag slots to keep, as well as the maximum value of item to delete, and now you can even select the quality of items to delete.
